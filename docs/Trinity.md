# Trinity Milestone

The goals to reach with this milestone are:

- Use the database (`CouchDB`) with the controller 
- Deploy an user accessible database for the actions (`MongoDB`)
- Provide support for storing static frontend content
- Support at least an external Kubernetes cluster (`AWS EKS`)
- Implement deployments of projects with the cli `nuv`
